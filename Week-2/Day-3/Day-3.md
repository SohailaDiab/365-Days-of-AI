# Time Series Analysis with Python 

## What is Time-Series Data?
It is a sequence of information which attaches a time period to each value. <br>
The value can be anything measurable that depends on time in some way, such as prices, humidity, or number of people.

As long as the values we record are unambigous, any medium could be measured with time series. <br>
There aren't any limitations regarding the total time span of time series (could be min, day, month, etc.). <br>
All that is needed is a starting and ending point. Usually, there are many other points in between the start and end of a time series.

All time-periods must be equal and clearly defined, which would result in a constant frequency.

**Time period:** The intreval of time between recording one point of the set and the next

**Frequency:** How often the values of the dataset are recorded.
