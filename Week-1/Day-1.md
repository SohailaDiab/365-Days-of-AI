## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning
### What is ML?
It is the science of programming computers so that they can learn from data:
- Learns from experience **E**
- On given tasks **T**
- And some performance measure **P**

*Performance on T as measured by P, improves with E*

Example:
Given a dataset containing the _features_ of cars (year, make, mileage, etc.) and a _target_ value (price), the machine learning model will learn the patterns in the data. We can then use this model to predict the prices of cars which we don't know, given that we have its features.


So generally speaking, machine learning is the process of extracting patterns from data. Data is usually of 2 types: features (info about the object) and target (what we want to predict

A model encapsulates all the patterns it learned from the data.




### Types of ML Systems
**Trained with human supervision or not:**
- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Semi-supervised
- Reinforcement

**Can learn incrementally on the fly or not:**
- Online
- Batch

**Work by comparing new data points to known data points, or by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive model:**
- Instance-based
- Model-based
