# 365-Days-of-AI ðŸ¤–ðŸ™Œ
Documenting my AI journey :D

For now (probably the next 3 months), I will mainly be following Alexey's **ML ZoomCamp** along with **Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow**.

Other than that, I will document my side projects as well as ML and DL topics that I learn about.
